# SPOTIFY PLAYLIST CREATOR

## How it works
All you need to do is search the name of a song (you could throw in the artist as well) and it will display the best matches for that song - just like the spotify search bar does.

Once you have your search results, just start adding songs away to the new playlist! 
This new playlist will have a predefined name as "New Playlist" but if you tap on the 'New Playlist' text you're able to change it to whatever name you want.

After your dream playlist is done, go ahead and click the 'Save to Spotify' button and it will automatically add it to your spotify library.

## How this web app differs from just using the actual Spotify app?

Well have you ever created a playlist on the app? You're adding songs but you've forgotten which songs you've add so you either try adding it again or go back and see. Here you can keep track of what songs are already there to save time.
